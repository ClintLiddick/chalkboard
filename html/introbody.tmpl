		<p>Chalkboard allows streamlined communication between Teaching Assistants and Students. Whereas other large
		systems require dedicated administrators and seem to make life harder, Chalkboard is simple.</p>

		<p>Simply <a href="">
		Login</a> with your Google Account, set your school email, and create a class page. Then you're all set to
		import a student list, setup meeting times, post examples and announcements, and manage class notes and
		presentations, all from a simple dashboard.</p>
